     formerly known as Madras is the capital city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. This metropolis is often called the cultural capital of India for its deep-rooted traditions and long heritage. The city is the gateway to the rest of South India. It has the 2nd longest seashore in the world, located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. With a population of around six million, it is Indias fourth largest city.

        The city was established in the 17th century by the British, who developed it into a major urban centre and naval base. By the 20th century, it had become an important administrative centre, as the capital of the Madras Presidency.
